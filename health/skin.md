Big picture: biology of facial aging
- Four fundamental changes with age:
  - Skin: cumulative UV/HEV/IR damage to collagen, elastin, ECM; thinning; fine lines; uneven pigment.
  - Volume: atrophy of distinct facial fat compartments; cheek descent; temple hollowing; tear troughs; some compartments (e.g., nasolabial) may hypertrophy.
  - Ligaments/gravity: osteocutaneous ligaments (orbital retaining, malar, temporal, mandibular, masseteric) become visible as volume/bone recedes.
  - Bone: CT-based longitudinal studies (Rohrich, Pessa) show resorption/recession of orbital rims, maxilla, mandible, frontal bone; scaffolding narrows with age.
- Early, most noticeable change: eye region (periorbital bone loss + fat atrophy).
- Sex differences:
  - Women accelerate facial aging ~50–70 (bone and fat loss, especially mandible), worsened by menopause; HRT likely beneficial for facial bone health.
  - Men usually hold facial structure longer but then also age.
- Facial fat is metabolically unique by compartment; shows color/composition differences (e.g., beta-carotene content); responds differently than body fat. Weight cycling (e.g., pregnancies) thins the face despite return to pre-pregnancy weight.
- Stress/cortisol: contributes to adverse skin/fat aging in the face (inflammation; volume loss; texture), despite body fat gain from cortisol.
- Melanin/phototype:
  - Fitzpatrick I–VI: darker skin (higher melanin) ages more slowly due to UV protection (melanin forms a “parasol” over nuclei).
  - Tanning is a protective melanin upregulation.
- Aesthetics are evolutionarily/psychologically rooted (symmetry, proportion/averageness, sexual dimorphism). Social media amplifies exaggerated traits and beauty pressure.

Ethics, trends, and provider selection
- Concerning trends:
  - Overfilling (lips, cheeks); hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers often persist years (not just 12 months), alter anatomy, stretch ligaments; can complicate future surgery.
  - “Snatched/high-arched brow” requests; surgeons should decline extreme distortion.
  - Teen requests for lip filler and “preventative Botox” (not needed at 18).
  - Social media filters/angles distort proportions; patients bring filtered photos (“social media dysmorphia”).
- Safety and oversight:
  - Broad, uneven regulation; injections performed by a spectrum of providers; ensure physician oversight and management of complications.
  - Conflicts of interest: many practices sell procedures and products; patients must do homework.
- Choosing a surgeon/provider (red/green flags):
  - Board certification in the relevant specialty and procedure.
  - Procedure volume/year as a proxy for expertise (examples given):
    - Rhinoplasty ≥ ~25/year.
    - Facelift ≥ ~25/year.
  - Specialization on face if you’re having facial work (don’t pick a generalist doing heavy body work for a complex facial procedure).
  - Ask personal complication and retreatment rates (not just literature averages).
  - Review before/after on patients with similar anatomy; discuss tradeoffs and alternatives.
  - Academic engagement (publishing, teaching, presenting) suggests evolving technique and critical thinking.
  - Willingness to say no; custom planning (not cookie-cutter); time spent understanding goals and psychology.

Absolute minimum daily skin care
- Mineral sunscreen, every day.

Sunscreen specifics (products, actives, protocols)
- Prefer exclusively mineral sunscreens (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide; micronized if possible) over chemicals.
  - Concerns with chemical filters (e.g., avobenzone, oxybenzone):
    - Bloodstream detection after application; possible endocrine disruption (infertility concerns); ROS generation upon UV absorption causing DNA injury; rapid inactivation (~1 hour in strong sun) while film remains (false sense of security). FDA now requiring animal safety studies.
  - Use case: chemicals “blend” better (no white cast) but trade-offs above.
- SPF notes:
  - Mineral SPFs effectively cap around ~50; be skeptical of >50 mineral claims.
  - People still get skin cancer despite “sunscreen use” likely due to chemical SPF issues/compliance and cumulative exposure.
- UV and beyond:
  - UVA (aging), UVB (burning/cancers), HEV light, visible light, IR (possible fat/bone remodeling hypotheses). All matter for pigmentation/aging.
- Brands explicitly mentioned:
  - EltaMD (verify formula is mineral; they make both mineral and chemical products).
- Hat and reapplication emphasized.
- Evidence: 4-year randomized Australian study—daily sunscreen users aged better (fewer lines/wrinkles).

Core anti-aging topicals (what, why, how, brands)
- Retinoids (collagen/elastin/GAG synthesis; normalize keratinocyte turnover and melanocyte function; DNA repair signaling)
  - Forms:
    - Retinol (weakest; 2-step conversion).
    - Retinaldehyde (middle step; more enzyme available; often less irritating; good bridge for sensitive users).
    - Retinoic acid (tretinoin; prescription; “gold standard” from mid-40s onward).
  - Tretinoin concentrations mentioned: 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1% (also 0.04%, 0.08%).
  - Protocols:
    - Nightly long-term use; don’t stop in summer.
    - Acclimation strategies:
      - Daily use to push through 6–8 weeks of irritation (if patient can tolerate).
      - Or start 2–3x/week and build to nightly over ~2 months.
      - Mix a small amount with OTC hydrocortisone 1% initially to reduce irritation (short-term).
      - Hybrid schedule for quit-prone: e.g., 5 nights/week retinaldehyde + 2 nights/week tretinoin, then advance.
    - Application amount: “fingertip unit” = from fingertip to DIP joint of index finger for whole face nightly.
    - Include under-eyes; upper eyelids once weekly; neck 1–2x/week.
  - Cost: ~$80–$100/tube; ~3 months of nightly use per tube.
  - Photosensitivity: initial exfoliation increases sensitivity; with chronic use stratum corneum normalizes and sensitivity lessens; still use mineral SPF daily.
- Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) and antioxidant serums
  - Why:
    - Collagen synthesis cofactor (proline hydroxylation).
    - Potent antioxidant—removes oxidative injury, may reverse some damage.
    - Regulates tyrosinase pathway—evener skin tone/complexion across phototypes.
  - Stability matters:
    - Many cheap formulas oxidize before you use them.
    - Stabilization methods: ferulic acid co-formulation (distinct smell), microencapsulation, oil-based carriers (with their own trade-offs), nitrogen-vapor manufacturing.
  - Use both morning and night:
    - Antioxidant reserve depletes over the day; reapply nightly to support night repair (autophagy/mitophagy).
  - Brands mentioned:
    - SkinCeuticals (C E Ferulic; stabilized with ferulic acid; effective but has a smell some dislike).
    - Obagi (manufactured under nitrogen vapor; Susan Obagi MD line; they cite data penetrating ~4x deeper vs SkinCeuticals).
    - SkinBetter (good products mentioned).
    - AVYA (transcript rendered as “AAS/AVIA”—Tanuj’s line; microencapsulated vitamin C serum, includes retinol and niacinamide; Ayurvedic botanicals like turmeric for anti-inflammatory benefit).
  - Other antioxidants named: niacinamide, silymarin (“sulomearin”), phloretin.
- Cleansers
  - Use gentle glycerin-based, non-foaming facial cleanser; avoid stripping surfactants/body soap on face (barrier/microbiome protection).
- Moisturizers/occlusives
  - Deep occlusion overnight thickens/rehydrates the skin; reduces fine crinkles.
  - Cheapest “trick”: Aquaphor (petrolatum) nightly; $6 at Walgreens; significant improvement in 30 days (but messy).
  - Many men 40s–50s may not need a separate PM moisturizer if using serums/retinoid; more mature skin tends to need added moisturizer.

Simple starter routines (protocols)
- AM
  - Cleanser (gentle, glycerin-based).
  - Antioxidant serum (e.g., vitamin C—or “super antioxidant” complex).
  - Mineral sunscreen (zinc/titanium; SPF ~30–50).
  - Optional for oily/clogged skin: alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) or polyhydroxy acids (PHA) after serum, before sunscreen.
- PM
  - Cleanser.
  - Antioxidant serum (again, to replenish after day’s depletion).
  - Retinoid (retinaldehyde or tretinoin depending on age/tolerance).
  - Optional moisturizer/occlusive if needed for barrier or dryness.

Acne management (protocols, agents)
- Treat early—prevent scarring (psychological impact lifelong).
- Types:
  - Comedonal (whiteheads/blackheads): low scarring risk unless picking.
  - Inflammatory pustular: moderate scarring risk (don’t pick).
  - Cystic acne: dermatologic “medical emergency” due to high scarring/psychosocial burden; often genetic.
- Accutane (isotretinoin) oral
  - First-line for cystic or severe inflammatory; dries sebaceous gland output; 5-month course.
  - Side effects: dry lips/eyes/skin; hair shedding at high doses; teratogenic—strict birth control in females; no alcohol (liver metabolism); lipid changes (↑TG, ↑cholesterol); monitor LFTs/lipids; adjust dose if needed.
  - Depression: evidence suggests acne patients are depressed; mood improves on treatment; suicidality causal link not supported.
  - Adult “oily skin” maintenance: 1 month/year course can reduce oil/pores/texture.
- Photodynamic therapy (PDT)
  - δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) topical incubation ~1 hour; activate with red light; selectively damages sebaceous units; useful if isotretinoin not an option; uncomfortable; not universally offered.
- Antibiotics
  - Short-term benefit but do not address root cause; microbiome concerns; not preferred.

Injectables, fillers, and fat grafting (indications, risks, costs)
- HA Fillers
  - Risks: intravascular injection → embolism → tissue necrosis, vision loss, stroke (central face, nose, temple, glabella are highest risk zones; shared blood supply to internal carotid/ophthalmic arteries).
  - Use low pressure, cannulas, aspirate (as appropriate), deep anatomical knowledge; monitor for ischemic signs.
  - Longevity: HA can persist for years, altering tissues/ligaments; complicates later surgery.
  - Bruising: reduced with cannulas vs needles.
  - Cost example: ~$800–$1,000 per syringe; initial under-eye plan might be 1 syringe split between both sides, with a second syringe 3–4 months later if needed.
- Biostimulatory fillers
  - Poly-L-lactic acid (`Sculptra`): stimulates collagen; good for dermal thinning (e.g., marionette area) and in thin, high-metabolizer patients.
- Fat grafting (autologous)
  - When: larger global volume loss (temples, cheeks, chin, jawline, under-eyes), thin faces with normal BMI; more cost-effective long term if many areas need volume.
  - Harvest: ~120 cc typical; flanks preferred for stromal septae (connective tissue scaffold) along with adipocytes; abdomen also common (highest stem cell concentration).
  - Processing: centrifuge to remove tumescent fluid; add albumin (to restore oncotic pressure) per their protocol; add patient PRP; prepare “nanofat” by meshing/emulsifying to enrich stromal vascular fraction; combine to improve graft take.
  - Placement: tailored by plane—subperiosteal for bony projection, intramuscular to fill valleys, subcutaneous for skin quality. Fat exhibits “site-specific” behavior; can hypertrophy with weight gain—advise patients not to gain “more than a few pounds.”
  - Benefits: living tissue; stem cells may differentiate by plane (bone/fat/muscle/skin); anecdotal observation that fat-grafted faces “age better.”
  - Lip fat grafting: less durable; under-eye grafting works well; avoid fat grafting just for one tiny area (too much procedure burden unless other areas need it).
  - Fat injection catastrophic risk: embolic events (especially via needle); technique critical.

Upper face and eye region (non-surgical and surgical approaches)
- Non-surgical
  - Neuromodulators (e.g., Botox):
    - Forehead: be cautious—over-paralysis in patients compensating for eyelid hooding leads to heavy/hooded look.
    - Strategy: treat depressors (glabella/crow’s foot/DAO) to “medical brow lift” by unopposed frontalis, rather than blanket forehead paralysis.
    - Platysma: treat bands to reduce downward pull on lower face/neck.
  - Tear trough filler: under-eye HA filler via cannula (less bruising); longer-lasting HA options exist now vs older; risks as above.
  - Dark circles mechanisms (four):
    - Visible orbicularis oculi muscle (no subcutaneous fat in eyelid).
    - Shadowing from ligamentous hollows (tear trough/ORL).
    - Hemosiderin deposition.
    - Hyperpigmentation.
- Upper blepharoplasty (upper eyelid surgery)
  - Insurance may cover if visual field testing shows functional loss (e.g., ~30% improvement taped vs untaped).
  - If frontalis is chronically compensating, unmasking after upper bleph can drop the brow—plan to (a) under-treat skin removal, (b) commit to ongoing neuromodulators, or (c) add brow lift when appropriate.
- Brow lifting
  - Endoscopic brow lift: posterior small incisions (can be made less visible in bald patients by placing farther back and meticulous closure); custom design required.
- Lower blepharoplasty (under-eye)
  - Transconjunctival approach; fat transposition:
    - Move lower lid fat pads into sub–orbital rim/cheek pocket to reduce bag, fill hollow, and “cover” orbital retaining ligament.
    - Combine with skin resurfacing (laser or chemical peel).
    - Address malar mounds (edema-prone triangle) with targeted injections; technique mentioned: dilute tetracycline injections to sclerose/reduce malar edema (newer, off-label approach).
    - Home remedy patients use: `Preparation H` (temporary de-puff).

Resurfacing and tightening (devices, peels, protocols, downtime)
- Concepts:
  - Any controlled injury that triggers repair can remodel collagen/elastin; more aggressive → more result and more downtime.
  - Choose modality by skin type (Fitzpatrick), pigment risk, goals, and downtime tolerance.
- Non-ablative (surface intact; minimal downtime)
  - Topicals: retinoids, antioxidants.
  - Light chemical peels (epidermal).
  - Non-ablative fractional lasers: examples mentioned include “Fraxel” (transcript said “fraal”) and `Clear + Brilliant` (superficial).
  - Vascular lasers (e.g., for rosacea; pulsed dye-like): shatters dilated vessels, reduces redness; also anti-aging benefits; repeat annually even if quiet.
  - IPL/BBL (intense pulsed/broadband light): large family; high-yield entry point with easy downtime.
  - RF microneedling: semi-ablative (needles breach skin; RF heats dermis) for collagen, pores, sebaceous activity.
- Ablative (epidermis removed in treatment zones; more downtime)
  - CO2 ablative laser (gold standard for maximal effect).
    - Downtime: 7–10 days of occlusive ointment; weeks 1–3 transition with marked redness/swelling; months of residual redness possible; concealer permitted ~3 weeks (also UV protection).
    - Pain control: in-office nitrous/oxygen devices can be used; or sedation.
  - Erbium:YAG ablative: less thermal injury; faster recovery than CO2 (less downtime but less dramatic single-session effect).
  - Chemical peels:
    - Medium-depth TCA peels to papillary dermis: sweet spot for tightening; great for large pores (solution percolates pores and contracts on healing); can feather into hairline, brows, ears, neck.
    - Phenol peels: for redundant lower eyelid skin; also used strategically periorbitally.
    - Deep TCA: effective but requires expertise due to risk; provider-dependent.
- Combination strategies (single session)
  - Face-wide medium-depth TCA; add fractional ablative CO2 to perioral lines; phenol peel to lower lids.
  - `Clear + Brilliant` same day + light chemical peel → 3–4 days of peeling; cumulative over time.
  - Stacked fractional erbium at lower intensities quarterly can approximate one full CO2 over time (for those unable to take extended downtime).
  - Ultrasound/RF skin tightening:
    - Historically used for neck tightening; underwhelming alone; risk of fat atrophy in younger patients (<40–45) → caution.
    - Possible synergy when combined with a biostimulatory filler like `Sculptra`.
- Fitzpatrick IV–VI or pigment-prone skin:
  - Ablative lasers carry higher risk for permanent dyspigmentation; chemical peels often safer; pretreat to quiet melanocytes (they alluded to hydroquinone “hydro…”).

Face analysis frameworks (how they structure plans)
- Tanuj’s four domains: skin, volume, gravity/ligaments, bone (plus dynamic muscle).
- Susan’s “5 Rs”:
  - Relax (overactive muscles; neuromodulators).
  - Refill (lost volume; fat or fillers).
  - Resurface (skin quality; peels/lasers).
  - Redrape (lift: RF microneedling/ultrasound devices or surgical facelifts/neck lifts as needed).
  - Renew (maintenance; keep results with ongoing skincare and periodic treatments).

Costs or numbers mentioned
- HA filler: ~$800–$1,000/syringe; initial under-eye ~1 syringe split; possibly repeat 3–4 months later.
- Tretinoin: ~$80–$100/tube (~3 months nightly).
- Aquaphor: ~$6 at Walgreens.
- Ablative CO2 downtime: 7–10 days occlusion; 1–3 weeks high redness; months redness possible.

Other notable protocols, measurements, or clinical pearls
- “Fingertip unit” dosing for tretinoin: fingertip to DIP joint for entire face nightly.
- Order of application: thinnest to thickest (serums before creams/occlusives).
- Apply vitamin C/antioxidants both AM and PM; retinoid at night.
- Include under-eye and upper eyelid (weekly) in retinoid plan.
- For darker skin or pigment-prone patients considering lasers: pretreat melanocytes (they alluded to “hydro…”—likely hydroquinone) and consider peels over ablative lasers.
- Under-eye: eyelid has no subcutaneous fat; skin lies directly over muscle (orbicularis oculi).
- Malar mound: edema triangle worsens AM/salt; treat with lifestyle, topical decongestants (patients use Preparation H), or targeted injections (dilute tetracycline).
- Insurance for upper bleph: visual field testing taped vs untaped (e.g., ~30% difference).
- Camera/mirror asymmetry and “subconscious posing”: why candid photos can be jarring; many patients unaware of facial asymmetries until pointed out.
- Teenage consent: ≥18 can consent; ethical preference for parental involvement for older teens; occasional off-label teen procedures with parental consent (e.g., nonsurgical rhinoplasty for hump camouflage).

Example targeted plan for “Peter-like” case (as discussed)
- Primary concern: under-eye hollow/bag and long lid–cheek junction (tired look).
  - Option 1 (non-surgical): under-eye HA filler via cannula; expect less bruising vs past; may need 1–2 syringes over time; address adjacent cheek volume as needed; use longer-lasting HA for tear troughs; consider `Sculptra` in midface for dermal thickening; treat platysma bands with neuromodulator.
  - Option 2 (surgical lower lids): transconjunctival fat transposition to tear trough/cheek; resurfacing of lower lids (laser or peel); malar mound injections with dilute tetracycline to reduce edema; downtime and higher stakes discussed.
- Upper lids: sufficient dermatochalasis to likely qualify for insurance-covered upper bleph; but must plan for brow behavior afterward; consider “medical brow lift” with neuromodulator to depressors or endoscopic brow lift if/when ready; “undertreat” upper bleph if not addressing brow to avoid heavy brow drop.
- Skin quality: start consistent daily routine (AM: cleanser + vitamin C/antioxidant + mineral SPF; PM: cleanser + vitamin C/antioxidant + tretinoin). Consider quarterly low-downtime resurfacing (e.g., `Clear + Brilliant` + light chemical peel same day) stacking benefit if unable to take 1–3 weeks downtime for ablative CO2. Avoid body soap on face; consider occasional AHA/PHA if clogged.
- Neck: neuromodulator for platysma bands to reduce downward pull on jawline.
- Sunscreen: verify `EltaMD` product is mineral; use daily (indoors and brief outdoor time); hat; reapply for prolonged sun.

Social media, beauty standards, and counseling notes (select)
- Patients should avoid chasing trends (lip size cycles; exaggerated brows); aim for natural enhancements aligned to personal anatomy; beware influencer filters/angles.
- “Beauty pressure” is intense for teens; avoid early/baseless injectables; screen for mental health and timing around life crises; use reversible, low-risk steps first and build trust.

Caveats and risks emphasized
- Filler vascular events: vision loss, stroke, necrosis—especially in nose, central face, temples, glabella—require expert injectors, proper technique, and immediate management capability.
- Laser/peel risks in darker skin: higher dyspigmentation risk with ablative lasers; consider peels/pretreatment.
- Ultrasound/RF tightening: risk of fat atrophy in younger patients; use judiciously, consider synergy with `Sculptra`.
- Over-treating forehead with neuromodulator in compensators: can worsen hooding; tailor to muscles.
